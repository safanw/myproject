        <p>In progress review: <b>Alan Wake 2 - A Triumphant Return to Darkness</b><br><br>

            It's been a staggering 13 years since the release of the original Alan Wake, and the anticipation for its sequel has been palpable. The wait, in my experience, has been worth every moment.
            
            For those unfamiliar with Remedy's other titles, especially the critically acclaimed "Control", you might find yourself missing out on some intricate details and Easter eggs. Remedy has a knack for weaving their games into a shared universe, and Alan Wake 2 is no exception. The game is peppered with references, nods, and winks to their other titles, making it a treat for long-time fans. From the appearance of Sam (who many might recognize as Max Payne) to the Sheriff (a nod to Quantum Break), and even Ahti and Casper Darling from Control, the game feels like a mix of Remedy's best games so far.<br> <br>
            
            Performance-wise, Alan Wake 2 is a heavy. It's reminiscent of the original Alan Wake's attempt to push the boundaries of what gaming hardware could do at the time (see: More on Alan Wake & Multi-core Gaming - Fall IDF 2006, AnandTech, 27 Sept 2006 — The game will actually spawn five independent threads: one for rendering, audio, streaming, physics and terrain tessellation.
            
            While the raytracing and pathtracing aren't necessary for gameplay, they elevate the visual experience to a cinematic level. On my setup, which includes a 3060ti and a 3600 running at 1080p, I manage to get a decent 50-70FPS. It's heavy, but the beauty of the game makes it worth the hardware strain. And for those concerned about performance, as long as you're achieving 30-60 FPS at your desired resolution, the game promises a smooth experience. Remember, as far as i'm aware, consoles are locked to 30 FPS w/o any fancy RTX either, but i could be wrong here.
            For a more through technical analysis do check out digitals foundry review of the game linked <a href="https://youtu.be/QrXoDon6fXs?si=LdBB48-RmMwHuV8e" target="_blank"> HERE. </a><br> <br>
            
            6 hours into the game, and I'm thoroughly engrossed. Remedy has always excelled at storytelling, and Alan Wake 2 is no exception. The narrative is gripping, and the occasional jump scares, especially during scene transitions, have caught me off guard more than once. For the optimal experience, I'd recommend playing this in a dark room, on a large OLED screen, with headphones on. It's an immersive experience that few games this year have managed to offer. In fact, it's one of the rare titles I've managed to play for a full 3 hours with minimal issues, experiencing slow loading times. <br><br>
            
            There's been some chatter about the game feeling "cinematic" or "like a movie", and to that, I'd say – that's the point. Alan Wake has always been about the narrative, structured in a chapter-like format akin to a novel. It's linear by design, focusing on story progression rather than open-world exploration. This isn't a sandbox; it's a carefully curated narrative experience.
            
            For newcomers to the series, I'd highly recommend playing the original Alan Wake and Control if possible. Both games provide valuable context and enrich the experience of Alan Wake 2, with numerous callbacks and overlapping story elements.<br><br>
            


           <img src="capture 5.jpg" > 
           <b> In conclusion, Alan Wake 2 stands out as one of my top contenders for Game of the Year, at least in terms of its narrative. It's a masterclass in storytelling, blending gameplay and cinematic elements seamlessly. For fans of Remedy and newcomers alike, it's a journey worth embarking on.</p></b>
